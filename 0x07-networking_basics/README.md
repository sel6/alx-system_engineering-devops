**Networking Basics**

***OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)***

is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design.
The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
There are 7 layers. Descending order:- Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link and Physical.

***Types of Networks***

**LAN** connect local devices together.
**WAN** connects LANs together. 
WANs are operating over the **Internet**.

***MAC and IP Address***

**MAC Address** is unique identifier of a network interface.
**IP Address** Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks.

***TCP and UDP***

**TCP** is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely.
**UDP** is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
